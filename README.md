prototype Node and React.
React is typescript.  Node is pure Javascript and getEmbedToken route is almost exact from Microsoft sample.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	In the root run npm i.  Depending on configuration you may need to install nodemon globally: npm i -g nodemon
2.	Switch to folder newdlx (that is React folder) and run npm i
3.	from the root run npm run dev. that will start node backe3nd on 5300 and react on 3000 and a browser.

4. To see APIs in Swagger open browser to http://localhost:5300/api-docs
